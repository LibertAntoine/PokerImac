## Building configuration 
### Clone repository 
In the local folder for the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LibertAntoine/PokerImac.git
```

### Execute 
Launch the project with [Unity 19.3.9](https://unity3d.com/fr/get-unity/download).

## Presentation
<p>
3D mock-up representing an interactive installation within the Saint-Lazare metro station, in Paris, and raising awareness of violence and harassment in public places, in particular transport area. The installation puts several passers-by in a situation of aggression against which it is possible for them to act collectively to arrest the aggressor.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to play with AIs, and choose, at the beginning of the game, the behaviour of these virtual players (make them more aggressive or with a greater tendency to bluff). AIs will rely on their own probability of winning, as well as various random variables that can be set by the player, to determine each of their actions.
</p>
<p>
This project is an initiative resulting from a lecture about statistics and probability at the IMAC engineering school.
</p>

Realized in May 2020.
